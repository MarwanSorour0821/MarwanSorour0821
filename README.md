### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, MarwanSorour0821
#### Digital Craftsman
My name is Marwan Sorour and I am a student at the University of Bristol, England, Bristol. I study Computer Science and Electronics(BEng).  My projects are either built from the ground up or are created using a skeleton code provided by the university. I have maintained a disciplined approach to my studies, ensuring that I meet deadlines, stay organized, and remain focused on my goals. I am also self-motivated where I always strive to challenge my current self in all areas of my life whether that be fitness, academics or seeking to be a knowledgeable well-rounded person. I read books on self-improvement, business strategies and economics to help me gain insight into how the world operates. I have been motivated to stick to this goal while also improving my academic endeavor. I try to always work on extracurricular programming projects that showcase my abilities and to add onto my current skillset. 

Skills: AWS / Java / Python / Go / C / Haskell / API / Flask
